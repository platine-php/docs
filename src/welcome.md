# Platine Framework

Platine Framework is a lightweight, high-performance, simple and elegant PHP Web framework. You spend **1 hour** to learn it to do something interesting, a tool in addition to the other available frameworks. Platine is a pursuit of simple, efficient Web framework, so that `PHP Web` development becomes even more powerful, both in performance and flexibility. If you like to try something interesting, I believe you will love it. If you think it's good, you can support it with a [star](https://github.com/platine-php/app/stargazers).

» Simplicity: The design is simple, easy to understand and doesn't introduce many layers between you and the standard library. The goal of this project is that the users should be able to understand the whole framework in a single day.
» Elegance: `Platine` supports the RESTful style routing interface, has no invasive interceptors and provides the writing of a DSL grammar.
» Easy deploy: using `composer`.

## Why another PHP Framework?

Well, I created Platine Framework for my own project, but decided to share with everyone.
I was also tired of all those bloated PHP Framework, with steep learning curve that create another language on top of PHP. Really?!
So this one is smaller. It is not bloated and contains some useful libraries, functions and tricks. And above all, it's damn simple.
